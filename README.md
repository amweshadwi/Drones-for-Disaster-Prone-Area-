Objective:
• Development of a Drone Delivery System equipped with a cargo box for medical supplies in the disaster prone area
Approach:
• Used suitable, lightweight yet robust carbon fiber material and reduced the amount of material used in non-critical areas
• Constructed of a cargo box beneath the drone for carrying the required supplies, with payload capacity of 2.0 Kg
Result:
• A lighter chassis can increase flight time and maneuverability, it may impact the durability and stability of drone
• This solution bridges healthcare gaps by delivering life-saving medications, even in emergency and disaster-prone areas
